/*
 * Update path from 0.1.1 (extension_drop's last REAL published PGXN release,
 * 2017 -- recovered from PGXN's dist archive as sql/extension_drop--0.1.1.sql
 * since it was never committed to this repo's git history; see RELEASE.md
 * and HISTORY.asc) to `stable` (this repo's current in-development source).
 *
 * The only actual behavioral delta between the two, found by diffing the
 * recovered 0.1.1 script against current sql/extension_drop.sql, is the
 * extension_drop__event_trigger() function body gaining one entry-point
 * RAISE DEBUG line (added in the same commit that also fixed a cat_tools
 * function rename -- see git history of sql/extension_drop.sql). That's the
 * one change here.
 *
 * Two other differences the diff turned up are deliberately NOT replayed
 * here, because neither one changes anything about the objects this
 * extension leaves behind after install completes:
 *   - The client_min_messages save/restore HISTORY.asc's `stable` section
 *     documents removing: that code only ever ran inside the install
 *     script's own session, saving/restoring a GUC and dropping its own
 *     temp table before the script finished -- nothing it did was ever part
 *     of the extension's persisted state, so an already-installed 0.1.1 has
 *     nothing left to clean up.
 *   - cat_tools.function__arg_types_text() being renamed to
 *     cat_tools.routine__parse_arg_types_text(): that call only happens
 *     inside the CREATE EXTENSION script's internal __extension_drop.create_function()
 *     builder, transiently, to compute the argument list text for the
 *     REVOKE/GRANT statements it executes immediately -- it's never stored
 *     in any persisted function body. (cat_tools 0.3.0 also keeps the old
 *     name as a deprecated wrapper, so a fresh `CREATE EXTENSION
 *     extension_drop VERSION '0.1.1'` still works today for testing this
 *     very update path.)
