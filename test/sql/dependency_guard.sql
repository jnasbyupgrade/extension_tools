/*
 * Dependency-guard proof. This protects a future "existing" mode CI run
 * (extension_drop already installed by a real pg_upgrade, or an ALTER
 * EXTENSION UPDATE done outside the suite -- see test/install/load.sql and
 * the Makefile's TEST_LOAD_SOURCE machinery): nothing today stops an
 * accidental CASCADE drop, a stray CI step, or a logic bug from silently
 * destroying the real updated/upgraded objects that mode exists to
 * validate -- after which the suite would quietly pass again against a
 * fresh reinstall instead of the thing it was supposed to check.
 *
 * The fix is a view with a HARD pg_depend dependency on a stable
 * extension_drop member: something the extension only ever extends, never
 * drops or redefines. extension_drop__commands is exactly that -- it's the
 * one state table every other object in this extension revolves around
 * (get/add/remove/update, the sanity checks, and the event trigger all key
 * off it); getting rid of it or changing its identity would be a rewrite of
 * the whole extension, not a routine update. Referencing its row type
 * (rather than a specific column) means the guard doesn't need updating
 * even if a future release adds a column to it. extension_drop has no
 * enums (unlike cat_tools' own guard, which types on an enum grown via ADD
 * VALUE) -- a stable table's row type serves the same purpose here.
 *
 * This test PROVES the guard works instead of assuming the SQL is correct:
 * it attempts the actual non-CASCADE DROP EXTENSION and asserts it fails,
 * then asserts both the extension and the guard view are still present
 * afterward. Everything here runs inside pgTAP's own rolled-back
 * transaction, so the guard schema/view never leaks into any other test
 * file.
